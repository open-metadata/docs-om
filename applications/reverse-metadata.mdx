# Reverse Metadata

Reverse metadata lets you push selected metadata changes from OpenMetadata back to your source systems. This is typically used to keep ownership, descriptions, tags, and other governance fields in sync.

Use the reverse metadata workflow from the UI or an external orchestrator to control what gets written back.

## Custom SQL Template

Some connectors allow custom SQL to control how reverse metadata is applied.
Use the connector-specific reverse metadata section for supported variables and examples.
