In this section, we provide guides and references to use the SFTP connector.
Configure and schedule SFTP metadata workflows from the OpenMetadata UI:
- [Requirements](#requirements)
- [Metadata Ingestion](#metadata-ingestion)
- [Troubleshooting](/v1.12.x-SNAPSHOT/connectors/drive/sftp/troubleshooting)
## Requirements
### Metadata
To extract metadata from an SFTP server, the user needs to have:
- A valid SFTP account with either username/password or SSH private key credentials
- Read access to the directories and files to be catalogued
- Network connectivity from the OpenMetadata ingestion host to the SFTP server

The user should be able to:
- Authenticate to the SFTP server via the specified credentials
- List directories under the configured root directories
- Read file metadata (name, size, timestamps)

You can find more details about SFTP configuration in the [OpenSSH documentation](https://www.openssh.com/).
### Profiler & Data Quality
SFTP is a file storage connector. Profiler and data quality workflows are not supported for this connector.

## Connection Options
<Steps>
  <Step title="Connection Options">
    - **Host**: SFTP server hostname or IP address.
    - **Port**: SFTP server port number. Defaults to `22`.
    - **Authentication Type**: Choose between:
      - **Username/Password**: Authenticate using a username and password.
      - **Private Key**: Authenticate using an SSH private key in PEM format. Supports RSA, Ed25519, ECDSA, and DSS keys. An optional passphrase can be provided if the key is encrypted.
    - **Root Directories** *(Optional)*: List of root directories to scan for files and subdirectories. Defaults to `/` (the user's home directory).
    - **Directory Filter Pattern** *(Optional)*: Regex to only include/exclude directories that match the pattern.
    - **File Filter Pattern** *(Optional)*: Regex to only include/exclude files that match the pattern.
    - **Structured Data Files Only** *(Optional)*: When enabled, only catalog structured data files (CSV, TSV) that can have schema extracted. Non-structured files like images, PDFs, and videos will be skipped. Defaults to `false`.
    - **Extract Sample Data** *(Optional)*: When enabled, extract sample data from structured files (CSV, TSV). Disabled by default to avoid performance overhead.
