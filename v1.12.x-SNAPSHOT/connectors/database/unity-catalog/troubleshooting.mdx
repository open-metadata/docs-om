## Unity Catalog connection details

```
source:
  type: unitycatalog
  serviceName: local_unity_catalog
  serviceConnection:
    config:
      catalog: hive_metastore
      databaseSchema: default
      token: <databricks token>
      hostPort: localhost:443
      connectionArguments:
        http_path: <http path of databricks cluster>
  sourceConfig:
    config:
      type: DatabaseMetadata
sink:
  type: metadata-rest
  config: {}
workflowConfig:
  openMetadataServerConfig:
    hostPort: http://localhost:8585/api
    authProvider: no-auth
```

Here are the steps to get `hostPort`, `token` and `http_path`.

First login to Azure Databricks and from side bar select SQL Warehouse (In SQL section)


<img src="/public/images/connectors/unitycatalog/select-sql-warehouse.png" alt="Select Sql Warehouse" />


Now click on sql Warehouse from the SQL Warehouses list.


<img src="/public/images/connectors/unitycatalog/Open-sql-warehouse.png" alt="Open Sql Warehouse" />


Now inside that page go to Connection details section.
In this page Server hostname and Port is your `hostPort`, HTTP path is your `http_path`.

In Connection details section page click on Create a personal access token.

Now In this page you can create new `token`.

## Missing Tables or Lineage in Databricks (Unity Catalog) Ingestion

### Symptoms

-   Some schemas or tables that match the configured filter are not
    visible after ingestion.
-   Lineage is missing or incomplete for expected tables.
-   Schemas are visible, but no tables appear under them.

### Common Causes

-   The Personal Access Token (PAT) used by the Metadata Agent lacks
    required Unity Catalog permissions.
-   The user can list catalogs or schemas but does not have SELECT
    access on tables.
-   Required access to `system.query.history` is missing, preventing
    lineage generation.

### What to Check

-   Ensure the PAT user has:
    -   Permission to use the target catalog.
    -   Permission to use the target schemas.
    -   SELECT permission on all tables that should be ingested.
    -   Access to the `system.query` schema and `system.query.history`
        for lineage.
-   Confirm that metadata ingestion has completed successfully after
    permission changes.
-   Remember that lineage is generated only between ingested entities;
    if a table is not ingested, its lineage connections will not appear.
