# Data Contracts

Data contracts define the schema, quality expectations, SLA guarantees, and governance rules for data assets. Contracts can be attached directly to entities or inherited from data products.

## Supported Entity Types

Data contracts can be attached to the following entity types:

| Entity Type | Schema Validation | Quality Validation | Semantics Validation |
|-------------|:-:|:-:|:-:|
| Table | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ |
| Topic | ✓ | — | ✓ |
| API Endpoint | ✓ | — | ✓ |
| Dashboard Data Model | ✓ | — | ✓ |
| Stored Procedure | — | — | ✓ |
| Database | — | — | ✓ |
| Database Schema | — | — | ✓ |
| Dashboard | — | — | ✓ |
| Chart | — | — | ✓ |
| Pipeline | — | — | ✓ |
| Search Index | — | — | ✓ |
| API Collection | — | — | ✓ |
| ML Model | — | — | ✓ |
| Container | — | — | ✓ |
| Data Product | — | — | ✓ |

## Contract Sections

A data contract consists of several optional sections:

| Section | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Schema** | Expected column definitions — names, types, constraints |
| **Semantics** | Business rules — required owners, descriptions, domains, tags |
| **Quality Expectations** | References to test cases that must pass |
| **SLA** | Refresh frequency, max latency, availability targets |
| **Terms of Use** | Allowed/disallowed use cases, compliance requirements |
| **Security** | Access policies and classification requirements |

## Contract Status

| Status | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `Draft` | Contract is being defined, not enforced |
| `Active` | Contract is active and enforced |
| `Deprecated` | Contract is deprecated, will be retired |

## API Endpoints

| Method | Endpoint | Description |
|--------|----------|-------------|
| `GET` | `/v1/dataContracts` | List data contracts |
| `POST` | `/v1/dataContracts` | Create a data contract |
| `GET` | `/v1/dataContracts/{id}` | Get by ID |
| `GET` | `/v1/dataContracts/name/{fqn}` | Get by FQN |

| `GET` | `/v1/dataContracts/{id}/odcs/yaml` | Export to ODCS YAML |
| `POST` | `/v1/dataContracts/odcs` | Import from ODCS JSON |
| `POST` | `/v1/dataContracts/odcs/yaml` | Import from ODCS YAML |

## Inheritance

When an entity belongs to a **Data Product** that has a data contract, the entity inherits the contract's semantics, SLA, terms of use, and security rules. The entity can also have its own contract that takes precedence over inherited properties.
