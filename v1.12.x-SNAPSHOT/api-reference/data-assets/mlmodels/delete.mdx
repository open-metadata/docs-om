# Delete an ML Model

Delete an ML model by ID or fully qualified name. Supports soft delete (default), hard delete, and restore operations.

## Delete by ID

<ParamField path="id" type="string" required>
  UUID of the ML model to delete.
</ParamField>

<ParamField query="recursive" type="boolean" default="false">
  Recursively delete child entities.
</ParamField>

<ParamField query="hardDelete" type="boolean" default="false">
  Permanently delete the ML model. If `false`, the ML model is soft-deleted and can be restored.
</ParamField>

## Delete by Name

Use `DELETE /v1/mlmodels/name/{fqn}` to delete by fully qualified name.

<ParamField path="fqn" type="string" required>
  Fully qualified name of the ML model (e.g., `mlflow_svc.customer_segmentation`).
</ParamField>

<ParamField query="recursive" type="boolean" default="false">
  Recursively delete child entities.
</ParamField>

<ParamField query="hardDelete" type="boolean" default="false">
  Permanently delete the ML model.
</ParamField>

## Restore a Soft-Deleted ML Model

Use `PUT /v1/mlmodels/restore` to restore a soft-deleted ML model.

<ParamField body="id" type="string" required>
  UUID of the soft-deleted ML model to restore.
</ParamField>
