# Delete a Data Contract

Delete a data contract by ID or fully qualified name. Supports both soft delete and permanent (hard) delete.

## Delete by ID

<ParamField path="id" type="string" required>
  UUID of the data contract.
</ParamField>

<ParamField query="hardDelete" type="boolean" default="false">
  Set to `true` to permanently delete the contract. Soft-deleted contracts can be restored.
</ParamField>

<ParamField query="recursive" type="boolean" default="false">
  Recursively delete child entities.
</ParamField>

## Delete by FQN

Use `DELETE /v1/dataContracts/name/{fqn}` with the same query parameters.
