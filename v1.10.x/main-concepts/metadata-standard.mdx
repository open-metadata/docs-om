# OpenMetadata Standards

OpenMetadata Standards is the community-driven home for the schemas and ontologies behind OpenMetadata. It provides the canonical JSON Schemas, RDF/OWL models, and API specifications that power data cataloging, governance, lineage, quality, and observability.

Key highlights:

- **Comprehensive coverage**: 700+ JSON Schemas spanning entities, relationships, events, and configuration.
- **API-first**: REST and event schemas for search, feeds, webhooks, and bulk operations.
- **Semantic web ready**: RDF/OWL ontologies and SHACL shapes for knowledge graph and linked data use cases.
- **Standards compliant**: JSON Schema (Draft 07/2020-12), RDF/OWL, SHACL, JSON-LD, PROV-O.
- **Community driven**: Built and maintained by the OpenMetadata community with open governance.

## Schemas

The OpenMetadata standard is powered by [JSON Schemas](https://json-schema.org/), as a readable and language-agnostic
solution that allows us to automatically generate code for the different pieces of the project.

<Tip>

Curious about how OpenMetadata is built? You can take a look at the [High Level Design](/v1.10.x/main-concepts/high-level-design).

</Tip>

You can explore the JSON Schemas in different ways:

**1.** You can check all the definitions in [GitHub](https://github.com/open-metadata/OpenMetadata/tree/main/openmetadata-spec/src/main/resources/json/schema).
    Navigating through the directories you can find, for example, the definition of a [Table](https://github.com/open-metadata/OpenMetadata/blob/main/openmetadata-spec/src/main/resources/json/schema/entity/data/table.json).

**2.** If you prefer to stay in the docs, we also have you covered. We have converted the JSON Schemas to markdown files
    that you can explore following the left menu titles, or navigating the structure by clicking on `Next` at the
    end of each page. Again, this would be the structure of a [Table](/v1.10.x/main-concepts/metadata-standard).
    In this generation we wanted to maintain the same structure as the GitHub repository. Any empty file means that you reached
    a directory, but you can keep exploring until finding the right Entity, or you can also look for it using the Search Bar.
